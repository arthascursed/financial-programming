## Simple Interest Rates
Interest rates determine how much a financial institution is going to pay in exchange for holding a cash
deposit over a period of time. Calculate the future value of a deposit given the interest rate and the initial
value of the deposit, assuming a single period of deposit.

## Solution
You just need to use the mathematic equation for simple interest rate calculation, which is given by the expression:
V = P (1 + R)<br>
In this formula, V is the future value after a single period, and P is the present value of the deposit. With this formula, you can calculate the interest rate for a single period.
